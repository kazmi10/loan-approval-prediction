# Loan Approval Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning model to predict loan approvals. The model uses several classification algorithms to determine the likelihood of loan approval based on input features such as applicant income, loan amount, and credit history.

## Project Overview

- **Notebook**: `loan_approval_prediction.ipynb`
- **Algorithms**: Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors
- **Best Model**: Naive Bayes with an accuracy of 83.74%

## Repository Structure

- `loan_approval_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the model and data processing steps.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kazmi10/loan-approval-prediction.git

2. cd loan-approval-prediction
3. jupyter notebook loan_approval_prediction.ipynb (or colab)
4. Dependencies:
   Python 3.x
   pandas
   numpy
   matplotlib
   seaborn
   scikit-learn
   You can install the required packages using:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Results
The Naive Bayes model achieved the highest accuracy, making it the most suitable model for predicting loan approvals.
